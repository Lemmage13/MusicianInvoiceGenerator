# Musician Invoice Generator
The musician invoice generator is an invoice generator and tracker that I have designed for use by musicians.
Musicians will often perform at gigs, and need to send an invoice to the organisers to arrange getting paid.
For amateur musicians, this can feel complicated, and as income from these gigs grows, it begins to be important to track the income for tax purposes.
This invoice generator will allow the user to generate an automatically formatted invoice, with a systematically generated invoice number.
The invoice is made into an XPS document, which can be printed (including to PDF) by the user.
The generation of an invoice will save its details to a database, and also save the contact details.
The invoices can be viewed and sorted by time, and by their paid status, allowing the user to easily keep track of which invoices have been paid in or not!
The saved contact details can be used to automatically fill in future invoices, simplifying the process as your contacts book grows.
